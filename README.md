**Job Survey Analytics Visualization**

This project presents an analysis of a job survey dataset using Power BI. It highlights key trends in roles, salaries, programming language preferences, and satisfaction levels among data professionals.

**Tools Used**

* Microsoft Excel (data cleaning and preparation)
* Power BI Desktop (data visualization)

**Process**

* Imported the raw Excel dataset containing 630+ survey responses
* Cleaned the data by:

  * Removing empty or irrelevant entries
  * Standardizing job titles and country names
  * Formatting columns (e.g., age, salary) for consistency
* Transformed the data to prepare it for analysis:

  * Created calculated fields (e.g., average salary, average age)
  * Categorized data into meaningful groups (e.g., job roles, countries)
* Built interactive Power BI dashboards with charts and visuals to:

  * Compare salaries across roles and genders
  * Analyze preferred programming languages
  * Visualize respondent distribution by country
  * Assess work-life balance and salary satisfaction

**Key Insights**

* Python is the most preferred programming language
* Data Scientists and Architects report the highest average salaries
* Respondents are primarily from India, the US, the UK, and Canada
* Moderate satisfaction with salary and work-life balance across roles
